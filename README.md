## To do
- Navbar is not linked to any section of the page
- Dimensions of pricing blocks needs to be revised
- Features cards need the gradient overlay, was not entirely sure how to go about doing this over an image and text section but was going to search online for some inspiration to solve this.
- Last section with create an account button not done in time frame
- Footer at bottom not done
- Other resolution responsiveness not implemented

All things left to do are doable, I would be able to do them with a couple more hours to hand I would be able to complete everything, but I am happy to answer any questions as to how I would have went about doing these parts, as I am fully capable of doing this.
